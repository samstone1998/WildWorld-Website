# Worldwide website
This is a example site that I decided to make as I wanted to learn some more about Laravel as well as improve my front end design skills. This project did not involve any javascript but did involve using bootstrap for a responsive front end design and Laravel to create the back end.

The site is a template for a fake company called WildWorlds who are a company who allow people to learn and test there skills surviving in the wild. The example project consists of using routing and controllers in order to seperate the normal site from the blog pages and the admin backend.

The designs use Laravels templating system as this makes things easier when needing to make changes to multiple pages on the site. It also allows you to not have to rewrite the HTML in pages.

The project also uses SQL in order for creating and display blog posts and for allowing the admin to log in and out of the site on the backend. All of this is done using Laravels built in authenication feature and by using a MYSQL database on the local server.

## Technologies used:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Bootstrap
  - PHP
  - Laravel
  
## What could be improved
The way the templates are done in the backend could be changed and sections of the site could be split up better. The design could also be made a lot nicer by using javascript to make it more user friendly and visually fun with animations and transitions.

Being my first Laravel project and one of the first times using Bootstrap I know a lot of the styling and formatting could be changed and simplified by using more of bootstraps build in styling as well as Laravels built in features.

## Free for use
